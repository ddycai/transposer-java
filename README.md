Chord Transposer
================

Transposes a set of song lyrics and chords from one key to another. Run `Transposer filename current-key new-key`. For example: `Transposer wreckingball.txt Eb G`.
Please write the keys in the major format, as the program does not understand other keys (eg. instead of Am write C).
